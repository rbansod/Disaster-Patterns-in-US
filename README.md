# Disaster-Patterns-in-US
Using a Dataset discussing all the disasters happened in US since 1970, we have created a visualization of US map color coding
each state with their top disaster (fire, earthquakes, hurricane etc). This visualization gives us a brief idea about the occurence
of a specific type of disaster in a specific state.
